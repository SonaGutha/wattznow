# WattzNow Mobile App

**WattzNow mobile app** is a smart energy awareness app that helps users identify the best times to run high-energy appliances — like EV charging, laundry, or lawn care — based on real-time carbon intensity forecasts. The goal is to encourage cleaner energy usage and lower carbon footprints at the household level.

## Features

### Feature 1:
Users can enter a time window and task duration, and the app will query the backend to fetch carbon intensity forecast data from the third party API (ElectricityMaps API). The backend processes this data by aggregating and analyzing carbon intensity levels to identify upto top 3 lowest-emission time slots. These optimal periods are then presented in the app, allowing users to easily select a preferred slot and add it to their to-do list.

### Feature 2:
Users can view and manage their to-do list, including browsing all scheduled tasks and deleting any that are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

 **Frontend**: Android (Flutter).
  
 **Backent**: Python + Pandas + Flask
    
 **Data APIs**: Electricity Maps.
  
 **Storage**: In-memory.
